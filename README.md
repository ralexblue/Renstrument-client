Name:Rentstrument
link:https://renstument-app.now.sh/

Client-side:
All the client side is used with context with some deductions of state to be more easily read on how each component should function.Mobile-First-Design and a simple use of flex box to create panel for each item to display.A responsive user interface knowing what has happened if they submit and const change of state wit user interaction.Simple design to be minimalist from the app that it was inspired by and wil add more features in due time.

summary:
My app should function similarly to another popular application called Craiglist,but rather than multiple objects it should only be used to rent Instruments for people who have that extra guitar or  people who had never touched their bought drums. 
A person can make an account then login to that account.Onced login they can post instruments,for how many instrument they want to Rent out.The description should be used as price and Instrument condition.The user can edit and delete an instument they posted if they want to.Also a user doesn't have to make an account to see all Instruments all they have to do is browse the selections.
